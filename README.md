üõ∞Ô∏è The E.T. Beacon: A Gravitational-Wave Technosignature ‚Äì Jupyter Code & Data
This repository provides the full Jupyter Notebook-based analysis pipeline for:

"The E.T. Beacon: A Gravitational-Wave Technosignature"
Submitted to Nature Astronomy (Manuscript ID: NATASTRON-25020154)

Why This Repository is Designed This Way
This repository is structured to allow gravitational wave scientists‚Äîeven those with minimal programming experience‚Äîto easily replicate the findings using the exact methodology I used.

Why Jupyter Notebooks?

The entire analysis was conducted in Jupyter Notebook, making it the most accurate way to reproduce results.
Running a single command launches the entire pipeline in an interactive environment.
No deep programming knowledge is required‚Äîjust copy, paste, and run in Jupyter.

üöÄ Quick Start: Run the Analysis in Jupyter
